# Chatbot---AI-Conversation
This project implements a custom authentication system in React using the Context API and hooks. To create this, we define an AuthContext using createContext, which provides a shared state for authentication across the entire app. The AuthProvider component wraps around the app and supplies functions for login, register, and logout, along with user state and a loading indicator. These functions use mock logic (simulated with setTimeout) to mimic asynchronous API calls and store the user data and token in localStorage. This ensures the user's session is preserved even after refreshing the page. The useAuth hook simplifies access to the context, allowing any component to call login, register, check user details, or trigger logout. This setup makes it easy to manage authentication logic globally and cleanly, without prop-drilling or repeating code in every component.
